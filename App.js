This error occurs when using the Expo `Linking` API to handle deep links.  The `getInitialURL` method sometimes returns `null` even when a deep link is expected, leading to unexpected behavior in your application. This is especially problematic if your app is designed to perform actions based on the initial URL.  The issue isn't consistently reproducible, making it difficult to debug. The code below demonstrates a scenario where the function returns null despite having a deeplink.
