# Expo Linking.getInitialURL() Intermittent Null Return

This repository demonstrates a bug where `Linking.getInitialURL()` in Expo inconsistently returns `null`, even when a deep link is expected. This causes unexpected behavior in applications that rely on initial URLs for actions.

## Problem

The `Linking.getInitialURL()` method, used for handling deep links in Expo, sometimes returns `null` despite a deep link being present. This behavior is intermittent and difficult to reproduce reliably. The lack of consistency makes debugging complex.

## Reproduction

The `App.js` file shows a basic implementation where the app attempts to read the initial URL.  You'll likely experience inconsistent results.  The `AppSolution.js` offers a workaround.

## Solution

The provided solution in `AppSolution.js` implements a retry mechanism and a fallback strategy to mitigate the issue.  It continuously attempts to retrieve the URL until it successfully resolves or reaches a timeout.
